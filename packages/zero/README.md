# @sigx/zero

Unstyled, accessible component primitives for [SignalX](https://sigx.dev).
Components render a stable, machine-readable anatomy — `data-scope`,
`data-part`, `data-state` — and no styling; a design system is a separate CSS
artifact compiled by [`@sigx/zero-kit`](https://npmjs.com/package/@sigx/zero-kit)
(start with `@sigx/zero-basic` or `@sigx/zero-daisyui`).

```bash
npm install @sigx/zero sigx
```

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@sigx/zero/dialog';
import '@sigx/zero/css';               // layer order + token fallbacks
import '@sigx/zero-basic/css';         // ← the design system (swappable)

<Dialog.Root model={() => state.open}>
    <Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
    <Dialog.Popup>
        <Dialog.Title>Native top layer</Dialog.Title>
        <Dialog.Close>Close</Dialog.Close>
    </Dialog.Popup>
</Dialog.Root>
```

## Components

Button · Tabs · Collapsible · Accordion · Dialog · Popover · Tooltip · Menu ·
Select · Switch · Checkbox · RadioGroup · Slider · Progress · Field · Avatar ·
Toast · Combobox · Toggle · ToggleGroup · NumberInput · RatingGroup ·
TreeView

All state is one two-way `model` prop (sigx `Define.Model`) — bind a signal
property with `model={() => state.open}`, or leave it uncontrolled with
`defaultOpen` / `defaultValue`. No controlled/uncontrolled prop triplets.
Native-platform first: `<dialog>` +
top layer (no Portal), the `popover` attribute, `<details>`, real form
inputs. SSR-safe ids via `app.use(zeroPlugin())` per request.

Interaction state is published as data for the design system to style:
`data-focus-visible`, and press feedback on every interactive part —
`data-pressed` while the pointer/key is down (a press ends when the gesture
ends: captured pointers, like a slider drag, hold it until release),
`data-press-animating` until the press animation finishes, with the press
point as `--press-x` / `--press-y` / `--press-r`. Checkable controls
(Switch, Checkbox, RadioGroup) take the press from anywhere in their label
row and surface it on the visible control. That is what makes a
pointer-anchored effect like Material's ink ripple — or its selection-control
halo and slider-thumb halo — expressible as pure CSS.

## Typed vocabulary (opt-in)

The variant-axis props (`color`, `size`, `variant`, `axes`, `mods`) are open unions
by default — any design-system-declared value is valid, recommended names
autocomplete. They are generic on the component scope through an empty
`ZeroVocabulary` interface: a design system's **generated** `/register`
module (emitted by `sigx zero:build`; RFC 0002) augments it, and one
`import '@sigx/<ds>/register'` at the app entry narrows every component's
props to exactly what that design system's compiled CSS answers to — plus
theme names on the authoring surface (`setTheme('dimm')` becomes an error),
custom-property and breakpoint autocomplete, and per-category token keys
through the `cssVar(name)` and `token(category, key)` helpers. No import,
no change — the open unions stay.

## Vendor-named surfaces (`@sigx/zero/adapt`)

A design system that declares an `api` (see `@sigx/zero-kit`) ships a
generated `./components` module — zero's components under the vendor's own
prop names (`<Button kind="ghost" hasIconOnly>`), fully typed with no
`/register` import. The behaviour behind every such module is one generic
helper here:

```ts
import { adapt } from '@sigx/zero/adapt';
export const Button = adapt(ZeroButton, {
    props: {
        kind: { axis: 'variant', values: { 'danger--tertiary': 'danger-tertiary' } },
        hasIconOnly: { modifier: 'icon-only' },
    },
});
```

`adapt` delegates the base component's setup with a renaming view over its
props — one component instance, so slots, events, models, refs and lifecycle
pass through untouched, and reads stay reactive. The rendered attributes are
unchanged (`kind="ghost"` renders `data-variant="ghost"`, never `data-kind`):
renaming lives at the prop boundary, the anatomy contract does not move. The
spec is kit-generated and kit-validated data; `adapt` performs no validation,
and the generated `components.d.ts` (instantiating the exported `Adapted`
type) is the typed surface consumers see.

## For tooling / AI

- `@sigx/zero/anatomy` — every component's parts × states × flags as typed
  objects with a `selector()` builder.
- `@sigx/zero/manifest.json` — the same registry as JSON, states as
  ready-made CSS selectors.
- A part's `hiddenIn` lists the states in which the runtime sets `hidden` on
  it — `avatar.image` while `error`, `tabs.panel` while `inactive`. Rules for
  those states never paint, so a design system may leave them unstyled (and
  need not tell them apart from a visible state), and a generator can skip
  emitting them.
- **A slotted default is a text node; a consumer's symbol is an element.**
  Where zero renders default content at all, it renders bare text — no
  wrapper. That is a difference CSS can see, and design systems depend on it
  to decide whether to draw their own mark or leave the consumer's alone:
  `&:not(:has(> *))` selects the default, `&:has(*)` the override. Never wrap
  a default in an element.

  The one case today is `RatingGroup.Item`, whose default content is
  `★` (full) / `★` (half) / `☆` (empty). `half` is a **full** star on purpose:
  the half-star codepoint `⯪` (U+2BEA) is poorly covered in the common system
  sans stacks and renders as tofu, so rendering a *distinct* half is the design
  system's job — by drawing geometry, or by masking/clipping this glyph, both
  of which need a full-width star in all three states. The value itself never
  depends on the symbol: it lives on the hidden input, and each item carries
  its own aria-label.
- `llms.txt` — the compact spec for language models.
