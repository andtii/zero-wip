# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (breaking — pre-release)

- **The color contract is now a naming grammar, not a fixed vocabulary**:
  design systems declare their own roles (via `@sigx/zero-kit`); zero knows
  only the `--color-<role>[-content|-soft]` convention and the fixed base
  surfaces (`base-100/200/300/base-content`).
- `resolveColorToken` resolves by convention: `--x` → `var(--x)`, bare
  kebab-case identifiers → `var(--color-<name>)` (CSS-wide keywords,
  `transparent`, `currentcolor` excluded), everything else passes through.
  Named CSS colors like `'red'` now resolve as token names — write literal
  colors as `#f00` / `rgb()`.
- The `color` prop (`WithColor`) accepts any DS-declared role;
  recommended roles keep autocomplete.
- `manifest.json` `tokens.colors` is now `{ convention, required,
  recommendedRoles }` instead of a flat token list.
- `css/base.css` no longer registers `@property` for the eight recommended
  roles — registrations are emitted per-declaration by the kit into each
  design system's compiled `tokens.css`.
- Removed the fixed-vocabulary exports `COLOR_VARIANT_LIST`,
  `CORE_COLOR_TOKEN_LIST`, `COLOR_TOKEN_LIST`, `ColorVariant`, `ColorToken`,
  `CoreColorToken`, `SoftColorToken` in favor of `RECOMMENDED_ROLE_LIST`,
  `BASE_SURFACE_TOKEN_LIST`, `RecommendedRole`, `BaseSurfaceToken`,
  `ColorValue`.

- **Token categories replace the flat structural token list.**
  `STRUCTURAL_TOKEN_LIST` / `StructuralToken` are removed in favor of
  `TOKEN_CATEGORIES`, `TokenCategory`, `TokenCategoryId`, `TOKEN_KEY_PATTERN`
  and `tokenProperty`. A flat closed array could not express the open,
  design-system-declared keys the contract is built on — the same reason the
  color vocabulary stopped being a fixed list.
- `manifest.json` `tokens.structural` (a flat array of property names) is now
  `tokens.categories`, publishing the grammar: prefix, recommended keys,
  value syntax and intent per category. `cat.recommended.map(k => cat.prefix
  + k)` reproduces the old array.

### Added

- **Button** — one part on a native `<button>`, carrying all three variant
  axes. Zero shipped fourteen components and none of them was the one every
  design system is judged on; `data-variant` (outline / soft / ghost) had
  nothing to apply to.


- `css/base.css` ships fallbacks for the typography categories
  (`--font-*` families, `--weight-*`, `--leading-*`, `--tracking-*`).
  `--font-*` is families only; sizes remain `--text-*`.
- `css/base.css` ships fallbacks for the spacing and elevation categories
  (`--space-2xs`…`--space-2xl`, `--shadow-xs`…`--shadow-xl`), so zero
  primitives have sane density and elevation before any design system loads.
  A design system's own keys come from its compiled `tokens.css`.
- `css/base.css` ships fallbacks for the motion categories
  (`--duration-*`, `--ease-*`) and a global
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block neutralizing the
  recommended durations, so zero primitives honor the preference before any
  design system loads. A design system's own duration keys are neutralized by
  its compiled `tokens.css`.


- `CSS_COLOR_KEYWORDS` and `ROLE_NAME_PATTERN` are now exported from the
  contract. `resolveColorToken` resolves through them rather than through
  private constants, so `@sigx/zero-kit`'s mirrored copy of the contract can
  be compared against them by an automated parity test.

### Fixed

- `llms.txt` documented 4 of the 14 shipped components; it now lists all
  fourteen with their parts and notes which accept variant axes.
